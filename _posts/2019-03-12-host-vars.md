an example demonstrating the use of hostvars to get some information on the remote hosts
```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  gather_facts: True

- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
{% raw %}
    - name: print all the hostnames
      debug:
        msg: "{{groups['labservers']}}"

    - name: print the hostname, distribution and ip address of all the hosts
      debug:
          msg: "{{hostvars[item]['ansible_hostname']}} - {{hostvars[item]['ansible_distribution']}} - {{hostvars[item]['ansible_eth0']['ipv4']['address']}} - {{hostvars[item]['ansible_default_ipv4']['macaddress']}}"
      with_items: "{{groups['labservers']}}"

{% endraw %}
```
* In order to collect information all the other remote hosts, we set gather facts to true on the first section of the play.
* In the second section, first task prints all the hostnames in the group, `labservers`.
* Then we print out the information about these servers on to the stdout.
    * `hostname` - `distribution` - `ip address` - `mac address`
