## Basic Yaml Syntax

* Composed of key-value pairs, lists and dictionaries.
* Files open with three hyphens `---` on the first line and close with three  periods `...`
* List items are designated with a single hyphen and a space.
* Each list item should have the same indentation.
* Dictionaries are designated with a colon and a space followed by indented
  key-value pairs.

#### example yaml syntax

```yaml
---
- hosts: webservers
  vars:
    http_port: 80
    max_clients: 200
  remote_user: root
  tasks:
    - name: ensure apache is at the latest version
      yum: name=httpd state=latest
    - name: write the apache config file
      template: src=/srv/httpd.j2 dest=/etc/httpd.conf
      notify:
        - restart apache
    - name: ensure apache is running ( and enable it at boot )
      service: name=httpd state=started enabled=yes
  handlers:
    - name: restart apache
      service: name=httpd state=restarted
...
```

## Multiple Line Values
* It is frequently useful when working on Ansible playbooks to format input
  with line breaks. YAML lets us do this using PIPE and RIGHT ANGLE BRACKET ( |
  and > ).
* PIPE will take each line break as part of the input in the data that follows
  it.
* RIGHT ANGLE BRACKET will ignore the line breaks in the data input that
  follows it.

> Typically used to break parameters for readability.

#### example without line break

```yaml
- name: write the apache config file
  template: src=/srv/httpd.j2 dest=/etc/httpd.conf
  notify:
    - restart apache
```

#### example with line break


```yaml
- name: write the apache config file
  template: >
    src=/srv/httpd.j2
    dest=/etc/httpd.conf
  notify:
    - restart apache
```

## Special Cases in YAML
* YAML has the following special characters
  * `[]{}:>|`
* Escape all the special characters by using DOUBLE QUOTES `"`
* In ansible you will normally need to escape CURLY BRACES `{}`
  * `"{%raw%}{{ config_file_name }}{% endraw %}"` - an ansible example
* `yes` will be taken as `true` unless surrounded by quotes.
* Floating point numbers will be taken as numeric unless surrounded by quotes.
